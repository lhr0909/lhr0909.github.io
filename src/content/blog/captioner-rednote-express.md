Just wanted to share a story of mine for the past week. I am regular Red Note user and I saw a huge wave of TikTok Refugees flooding into the platform and trying to connect with Chinese people that are "native" to the platform on Monday. I didn't think too much at first, but then the wave just kept coming and coming for another 2 full days.

I have never been on TikTok myself, and the videos people uploaded were very amazing! I wanted to be able to share with my Chinese friends and family, who don't speak English. However, some of them do not have any subtitles, and some others only had English ones or poorly translated ones.

I have been building [Captioner](https://captioner.io/?ref=blog) to help people edit subtitles for their YouTube videos, specifically for the Cantonese-speaking content creators.

I was hesitating if I should pull the trigger and build a tool for these creators. Because first of all, I am not sure how the TikTok situation will go, it is just hard to say that how many of these creators will stay on Xiaohongshu and continue to create content for Chinese audience. On the other hand, as time went by on Tuesday and Wednesday, there were more and more creators found out ways to add Chinese subtitles to their videos. I was unfortunately occupied by other life duties and chores, and I could not write a single line of code.

I finally decided to do this, because I noticed this pattern for the submissions for users:

- People who are seasoned with editing videos, already has a workflow for creating content, they are likely not my users, because they already have something that does subtitles and translations.
- Who I am very interested in helping are content creators who likes to share with minimal editing and they need something just a bit more convenient than the editing tools.

With that in mind, I quickly switched to hacking mode on Wednesday afternoon at 2pm. I had a game plan in mind, and drafted out tasks that would get me to a minimum usable product that can [translate videos to Chinese and add subtitles for Red Note](https://captioner.io/rednote?ref=blog), and planned out the marketing / promotion items on the next day. By midnight, I have a working prototype and I deployed to production.

After a few hours of rest, I finished the landing page on Thursday morning, and set up a launch on Product Hunt, and submitting links to various places, including Red Note itself. I was already gaining some traffic by the end of the day on Thursday.

On Friday I woke up to some failed jobs at the backend and the Crisp chat went a bit crazy. Spent most of the day fixing issues and making small improvements on the go to make the minimal experience rock solid without issues. Saw some other people already spreading presence on the internet with the red note keyword and I started to follow suit and created a video on YouTube before dinner.

I went out for a walk in the evening and that's when I suddenly realized that I should probably do a quick check on Product Hunt and see how it went. And to my surprise, it was on the homepage of PH at the 7th spot.

I totally was not expecting that, and all I was hoping was to get a few more clicks from an active website, and being solo, I didn't tell anyone but my other indiehacker close friend about what I am building. But hey, I made it too!

At the time of writing, it seems like TikTok might stay and it is really up in the air about whether or how many people are going to stay on Red Note, but I have learned invaluable lessons from making a very focused small product and overcoming the fear of launching. This is my second year of indie hacking and I really needed a win, no matter how small.

I built this product almost a year ago, and I didn't spend any effort promoting, nor do I understand what features people desperately need when creating content. I now have a better understanding of finding that and most importantly, I no longer am afraid of doing any launches.

Thank you for reading this far! Cheers!
