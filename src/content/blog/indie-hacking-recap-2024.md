It has been a year since I decided to start indie hacking at the end of 2023 and released my first app. To be honest, this year has been quite a failure. Apart from the apps I've been maintaining, which has generated some income, the apps I worked on this year basically didn't make any money (current MRR at $45 collectively).

After reflecting, I think the reasons are as follows:

1. **The products I made were not essential, and the target audience was small.** If I want to do this full-time, I need to ensure that the features I develop are "painkillers", not just "vitamins".
2. **I didn’t spend enough time on marketing, and I often made excuses for not doing it.** Many times, I'd tell myself, "it is hard to add a blog to the current codebase," or "I'm not good at editing videos." Apps could have continuously attracted customers through consistent marketing efforts, but without content, it’s like fishing without bait.
3. **I lacked discipline and planning when I worked.** I often stopped halfway through updating features, and when I tried to pick them up again, it was difficult to get started, and my laziness got the better of me.
4. **The quality of the products was low.** I underestimated the learning curve of developing iOS apps. The quality, especially the app preview and onboarding sections, was poor, resulting in low conversion rates.

**What I did well this past year:**

1. **I provided good service to potential customers, which helped with conversions.** This was largely thanks to the sales skills I developed while freelancing on Upwork.
2. **I gained a lot of indie dev experience and now have built an internal framework for shipping products faster.**
3. **I tried and learned to do marketing, especially on setting up ad campaigns.**

**My goals for next year:**

In 2025, I am going to take indie hacking more seriously, especially around gathering requirements, conducting keyword research, and diving deeper into SEO, pSEO, ASO, and ad campaigns. The apps I make don't need to be complex, but they must address real needs. Additionally, I want to leverage my engineering strengths and consider working on more B2B products such as selling APIs or even boilerplate code.

**Goals for next year:**

1. **Before the Lunar New Year (Jan 28), put in enough effort for marketing and polishing existing products.**
2. **Release at least one more app by March, with a planned marketing strategy.**
3. **Hit $1,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) by June 2025.**
4. **Hit $3,000 MRR by the end of 2025.**
