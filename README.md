# My Minimal Astro Blog

This is a minimal blog system that I use to write. It is based on [Astro](https://astro.build). Styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The theme was based off of a hugo theme named [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch).

The main motivation is to set up a template that can pull my Obsidian vault notes at build time for the blog posts. This way, I can write my notes in Obsidian and have them published to my blog.
